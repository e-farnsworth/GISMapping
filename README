# Overview

For this project, I wanted to learn more about GIS mapping with Arc GIS. This project was also an extention to my investigations about house pricing across the USA. 

Since this project was an extention of my investigation about house prices across the USA, I used the same data set as last time: the [USA Real Estate Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/data) from Kaggle. As I was attempting to get the data I was using to work in Arc GIS, I quickly learned that the set as is was not friendly to Arc GIS. Though the data had the adress from each house, there were over a million houses to find locations for. Though there is a tool in Arc GIS that will attempt to do this for you, it does cost money.

This is where I switched gears, and I opted to showcase the mean house price of each state and the mean of the house prices in each state capital. There were already feature files that provided the information that I needed that allowed for the quick access of each State boundries and major cities in the US. I did need to filter the feature file containing the cities down to just the capitals but there is a simple way to do that. 

The overall purpose of this project was to get an introduction in GIS mapping. The topic is a facinating one and there are a lot of intereting things that can be done. I simply wanted to introduce myself to the process as I investigated into the house pricing data that I had already found.

# Future Work

* Add information on more cities than just the capitals
* Add the capital pricing information for Alaska and Hawaii again. Removed for original ease
* Create a heat map layer to showcase where data is present
